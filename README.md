Express has long been the leading HTTP server framework for Node.js applications, but Hapi.js is probably the the most popular alternative, with many devoted followers.

In this course you're going to learn Hapi.js from the ground up. If you haven't had a chance to look into Hapi before, now's your chance! You'll learn how to set up a new Hapi project, starting with serving static content and files. Next, you'll learn how to render dynamic pages with the Handlebars view engine, and how to handle user input in GET and POST requests.
